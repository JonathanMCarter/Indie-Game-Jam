Version History:

2.3.3

HotFix! 1&2 - Updated the discord invite, as it was broken, to be our redirect so it doesn't need updating again. Fixed the store page discord logo to be a proper logo to comply with the store requirements.

Fixed several minor issues with the inspector editor that would cause problems for users. 
~ Attempt to fix a bug where the inspector would reset after a build was made
~ Attempt to fix problems with the inspector not showing directories correctly
~ Removed old buttons that are not needed anymore due to the inspector updating itself on the go.
