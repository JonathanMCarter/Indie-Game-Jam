Version 1.0.1 Change Log:

* Store Listing Changes *
- Updated the asset title to remove the "(CG)" characters after the asset name. This has been replaced with "| CG" instead to look a little neater.
- Updated the main asset description to explain more about the asset and its features. 
- Updated all links to be correct for the asset.
- Updated to key images to all be the same size as the main key image.
- Updated the asset colour scheme to be more pastel, the old colour was a bit abrupt.

* Asset Changes *
+ Updated the Shortcuts Logo on the asset editor window.
+ Corrected the script templates so they have the correct spacing.
+ Updated commenting on all code.
+ Removed the correct folder option as it wouldn't work.

* Bug Fixes *
~ Fixed a bug where the script correct folder value would not work
~ Fixed the keyboard shortcuts for the windows so it doesn't interfere with the user writing capital letters. 
~ Fixed the script creation locations for the editor script will go into the editor folder.
